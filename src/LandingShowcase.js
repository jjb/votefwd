                  The mid-term election on November 6, 2018 will determine the fate of the country. We need Congress to fight the chaos and corruption of the Trump presidency. If Democrats flip <strong>23 seats</strong>, we’ll win the House, and the power to hold Trump accountable. But to win, we need everyone to vote!

                Sending a Vote Forward letter is one of the easiest things you can do. It takes two minutes and one stamp, and meaningfully increases the odds that the recipient will vote. A concrete action you can take, no matter where you live, to get unlikely-to-vote registered Democrats to the polls in November.

              <p className="lead mb-0">
                In a randomized controlled trial in the special election for U.S. Senate in Alabama in 2017, turnout among letter recipients was 3.9 percentage points higher than turnout in the control group. (3.4 percentage points after controlling for gender, age, and other factors). This is big! It appears to be one of the most effective known tactics to boost turnout.

              <p className="lead mb-0">
                Vote Forward volunteers wrote more than four thousand letters to infrequent voters to boost turnout in the OH-12 special election on August 7. Although the Democratic candidate did not prevail, the election was extremely close. Our best estimate is that letters boosted turnout in this race by 1.44 percentage points — not as shockingly large as the effect we saw in Alabama, but still substantial, especially given the very high baseline turnout. Volunteers are continuing to stockpile letters for the rematch in November.

                Vote Forward began as an experiment conducted by Scott Forman [<a href="https://twitter.com/sjforman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i className="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottforman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i className="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a>] in Alabama in 2017. Encouraged by the success of that experiment, Scott and a small group of friends and fellow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opower</a> alumni built this platform to empower volunteers to take easy and effective action. We believe our democracy depends on electing a Democratic congress, so we’re volunteering our time and expertise to achieve that goal.
